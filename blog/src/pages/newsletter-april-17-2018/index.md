Hello from the Catskills, where we're currently experiencing a mix of snow and rain. But the crocuses were in bloom over the past few days, and that'll bring a smile to any face.

There was no newsletter last week (instead I spent some time working on an upcoming revamp of the Scout Upstate calendar page). But this week's should more than make up for it.

## For the Bookworms and Naturalists

The Overlook Press released [The Quarry Fox](http://www.overlookpress.com/upcoming/quarry-fox-and-other-critters-of-the-wild-catskills.html), a new book by Leslie T. Sharpe, former Vice President of the New York City Audubon Society and a lifelong naturalist living on Lazy Hawk Mountain in the Great Western Catskills.

![](quarryfox_hc_cover.jpg)

From the publisher's description:

‚ÄúA red fox stands poised at the edge of a woodchuck den, his ears perked for danger as two pudgy fox cubs frolic nearby. A mother black bear and her cubs hibernate beneath a felled tree. A barred owl snags a hapless cottontail from a meadow with its precise talons. In *The Quarry Fox*, Leslie T. Sharpe trains her keen eye and narrative gifts on these and other New York wildlife through her tales of close observations as a naturalist living in the Great Western Catskills. *The Quarry Fox* is the first in-depth study of Catskill wildlife since John Burroughs invented the genre of nature-writing, in which Sharpe weaves her experiences with the seasons, plants, and creatures with the natural history of each organism, revealing their sensitivity to and resilience against the splendor and cruelty of Nature.‚Äù

See if you can find it in your local book store first, but if not, it's available from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Quarry-Fox-Other-Critters-Catskills/dp/1468312472) as well.

## Earth Day at John Burroughs Woodchuck Lodge

Learn how to get started in birding from veteran birder Joe Siclare at an event to raise funds for the pruning of the apple orchard at the John Burroughs center. $30 per family, first 20 to register will take home a locally made bluebird nesting box. J.N. Urbanski of [Upstate Dispatch has the details](http://upstatedispatch.com/2018/04/earth-day-at-john-burroughs-woodchuck-lodge/).

While we're mentioning Upstate Dispatch, you might also enjoy his post on [beekeeping](http://upstatedispatch.com/2018/01/bee-hopeful/), which was the first I'd heard of Anarchy Apiaries, a non-profit in Livingston Manor. [Anarchy Apiaries](http://anarchyapiaries.org/hivetools/) is ‚Äúdedicated to promoting bees and beekeeping whose mission is to 'make more beehives than televisions' and 'distribution of mite-and-disease-tolerant, cold-hardy mated queen bees, facilitating Beekeeping Bootcamp hands-on trainings, setting up every 7-year-old with their own bee hive, reinvigorating our own NY bee club- the B. A. N. D. (Beekeepers Association of Northern Dutchess), the New Bee Circus travelling bee medicine/training/puppet show, and modifying our bee-hauling van to run on waste vegetable oil'.‚Äù
