Hello from Upstate New York! It's 86 degrees and sunny here as I write this, and while there's some chance of clouds later in the week, the rain coming Thursday and Friday should be past by the weekend. I haven't included any events this week because I'm a bit out of time, but there are plenty of things happening and you can find them with a quick search. So get out there and have some fun around the Catskills this weekend!

## A Guide to Paddling on NYC Reservoirs

![](cannonsville_reservoir.jpg)

Want to kayak or canoe on a NYC reservoir (such as the Cannonsville Reservoir, pictured above) this summer? You'll need a free DEP access permit. This [guide](https://medium.com/nycwater/a-guide-to-paddling-on-nyc-reservoirs-b9528fc2d387) provides more information. And be sure to review the [recreational rules listed here](http://www.nyc.gov/html/dep/pdf/recrules/recrules.pdf). Kayaking is a lot of fun, and easy to learn, so don't be daunted if you've never gone before.


That's all for this week. Hope you have a great weekend!
